                        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My <b> Elementary </b> was filled with fun memories because back then we played all the games that you can think during  in our childhood days. Like for instance we roam around the school, cut classes, play Basketball, play Dakpanay, Langit- lupa, marbles, stickers, Bato-lata or the Manila-lata, slipper X or T and many more.  And it was best days of our childhood lives.</p>
