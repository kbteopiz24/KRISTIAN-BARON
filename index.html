	<h1> What is Food Waste? </h1>
<div class="p1">
<!-- This paragraph is all about Food Waste -->
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br> Food Waste </br>  when disposed of in landfills produces harmful greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming and climate change. Natural resources such as land, freshwater, fossil fuels, and human resources are also wasted. 

<h1>Why is food waste important?</h1>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wholesome food that is currently wasted could help feed families in need. Safe and wholesome food that is currently thrown away could help feed hungry people and reduce food insecurity today. Each year, Feeding America and its network of food banks rescues around 3.6 billion pounds of food. 

<h1> What are effects of food waste? </h1>
<p> &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp But wasted food isn't just a social or humanitarian concern—it's an environmental one. When we waste food, we also waste all the energy and water it takes to grow, harvest, transport, and package it. And if food goes to the landfill and rots, it produces methane—a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide. 

<h1> What are the types of food waste? </h1>
<p>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp "Food waste refers to food such as plate waste (i.e., food that has been served but not eaten), spoiled food, or peels and rinds considered inedible that is sent to feed animals, to be composted or anaerobically digested, or to be landfilled or combusted with energy recovery."
